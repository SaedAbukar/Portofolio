      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Saed Abukar, currently pursuing a degree in Software
        Engineering at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. With a deep
        passion for technology and problem-solving, I thrive on creating
        innovative and meaningful projects that make a real impact.
        <br />
        Whether it’s developing user-friendly applications or designing
        efficient systems, I am always eager to learn and apply new skills to
        overcome real-world challenges.
        <br />
        Outside of my studies and coding projects, I’m an avid football player,
        fitness enthusiast, and nature lover. I believe in balancing both mental
        and physical growth, which is why I stay active on the field and in the
        gym, and find inspiration in the outdoors.
        <br />
        I’m excited about the future and the opportunities to collaborate,
        learn, and contribute to projects that bring positive change. I’m always
        open to connecting with like-minded professionals and curious minds.
        Feel free to reach out—there’s a lot more to explore, and I’d love to
        share my journey with you!
      </p>
