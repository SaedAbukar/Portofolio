      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Saed Abukar – a Software Engineering student at
        Metropolia University of Applied Sciences with a love for building cool,
        meaningful projects. I’m all about learning, creating, and tackling
        real-world problems with tech. When I’m not deep in code, you’ll catch
        me out on the football field, at the gym, or just soaking in the beauty
        of nature. Stick around – there’s a lot more to come!
      </p>
